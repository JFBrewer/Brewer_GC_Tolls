# Brewer_GC_Tools
A collection of my GEOS-Chem tools for public use

Brewer_Planeflight_Writer is a simple R tool that can take as input a selection of LAT-LON-ALT-TIME points and a pair of easily modified text header files and output a properly formatted Planeflight.dat.YYYYMMDD for the GEOS-Chem planeflight menu.
